;;;; C Mode (from GNU Emacs)

(declare (usual-integrations))

(define-major-mode c fundamental "C"
  "Major mode for editing C code.
Expression and list commands understand all C brackets.
Tab indents for C code.
Comments are delimited with /* ... */.
Paragraphs are separated by blank lines only.
Delete converts tabs to spaces as it moves back.

Variables controlling indentation style:
 c-tab-always-indent
    True means TAB in C mode should always reindent the current line,
    regardless of where in the line point is when the TAB command is used.
 c-auto-newline
    True means automatically newline before and after braces,
    and after colons and semicolons, inserted in C code.
 c-indent-level
    Indentation of C statements within surrounding block.
    The surrounding block's indentation is the indentation
    of the line on which the open-brace appears.
 c-continued-statement-offset
    Extra indentation given to a substatement, such as the
    then-clause of an if or body of a while.
 c-continued-brace-offset
    Extra indent for substatements that start with open-braces.
    This is in addition to c-continued-statement-offset.
 c-brace-offset
    Extra indentation for line if it starts with an open brace.
 c-brace-imaginary-offset
    An open brace following other text is treated as if it were
    this far to the right of the start of its line.
 c-argdecl-indent
    Indentation level of declarations of C function arguments.
 c-label-offset
    Extra indentation for line that is a label, or case or default.

Settings for K&R and BSD indentation styles are
  c-indent-level                5    8
  c-continued-statement-offset  5    8
  c-brace-offset               -5   -8
  c-argdecl-indent              0    8
  c-label-offset               -5   -8"
