IMAIL To-Do List
$Id: todo.txt,v 1.3 2000/05/11 02:06:30 cph Exp $

* Eliminate message properties.  Store this information in the headers
  and translate as needed.  E.g. unix from line in umail message would
  be stored as header in RMAIL message.

* Reimplement UID synchronization.  Take advantage of monotonic UID
  numbers to discover largest prefix range that hasn't changed.
  Binary search can be used which should produce excellent results on
  large folders.  UID FETCH command should be useful for this.

* Write summary browser for folders.

* Implement operations for IMAP: %NEW-FOLDER, %DELETE-FOLDER,
  %MOVE-FOLDER, %COPY-FOLDER, AVAILABLE-FOLDER-NAMES, APPEND-MESSAGE,
  and SEARCH-FOLDER.

* Write folder browser for IMAP servers.

* Implement background thread to periodically send NOOP to IMAP server
  both to check for new mail and to keep the connection alive.

* Recovery from server disconnection should be more transparent.
  Should attempt to reconnect and signal error only if that fails.

* Implement cache that saves information about messages on disk.  This
  should use UIDs for IMAP folders; for other folders perhaps the
  message ID can be used.

* Write M-x imail-resend.

* Password memoization should be controllable from the editor.

* Must be able to handle malformed headers in incoming mail.
  Generating a low-level error in this situation is unacceptable.

* Try to leverage IMAP MIME parser by building compatible
  interface for file-based folders.

* Implement file backup when writing file folders.

* RENAME-FOLDER incorrectly uses RENAME-FILE when moving a file
  folder, which will fail on cross-device renames.

* RMAIL file reader must recognize when the tail of the file contains
  umail messages.
