IMAIL To-Do List
$Id: todo.txt,v 1.1 2000/05/11 00:47:42 cph Exp $

* Must be able to handle malformed headers in incoming mail.
  Generating a low-level error in this situation is unacceptable.

* Try to leverage IMAP MIME parser by building compatible
  interface for file-based folders.

* Implement file backup when writing file folders.

* RENAME-FOLDER incorrectly uses RENAME-FILE when moving a file
  folder, which will fail on cross-device renames.

* RMAIL file reader must recognize when the tail of the file contains
  umail messages.

* Write M-x imail-resend.

* Implement operations for IMAP: %NEW-FOLDER, %DELETE-FOLDER,
  %MOVE-FOLDER, %COPY-FOLDER, AVAILABLE-FOLDER-NAMES, APPEND-MESSAGE,
  and SEARCH-FOLDER.

* Write summary browser for folders.

* Write folder browser for servers.

* Implement cache that saves information about messages on disk.  This
  should use UIDs for IMAP folders; for other folders perhaps the
  message ID can be used.

* Reimplement UID synchronization.  Take advantage of monotonic UID
  numbers to discover largest prefix range that hasn't changed.
  Binary search can be used which should produce excellent results on
  large folders.
