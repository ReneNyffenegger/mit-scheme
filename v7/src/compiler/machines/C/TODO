* No consistency at band-restore time.
  The saved band may not correspond at all to the compiled-code blocks
  in the microcode.

* package loader, etc. have to understand initialize-c-compiled-block.
  runtime/make.scm was hacked specially.  Other systems will not work
  until this is done.

* Edwin autoloads and load options.

* Short documentation (how to compile files and add them to the microcode).

RANDOM INFO:
  USE: 	setenv CMDOPT -DBAND_ALREADY_BUILT
